## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned

I implemented a dynamic pricing feature for a landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project challenged me to deeply understand how to manipulate the DOM in real-time, especially with range inputs and toggle switches. I learned how to calculate and update pricing dynamically based on user input, and how to effectively use CSS for creating a clean and responsive UI. I also gained experience in implementing custom user interactions like switching between monthly and yearly billing, with real-time price adjustments.

```js
switchToggle.addEventListener("change", function () {
  isYearly = !isYearly;
  activePrices = isYearly ? yearlyPrices : monthlyPrices;
  activeBillingPeriod = isYearly ? "/ year" : "/ month";

  const index = priceRange.value;

  updateUI(index);
});
```

### Continued development

I also aim to explore more advanced JavaScript concepts such as debouncing for better performance with real-time data updates. Additionally, I want to dive deeper into accessibility features, ensuring that all interactive elements are fully accessible to all users. Finally, I'd like to experiment with CSS animations to make the user experience even more engaging.
